# Be organized

This project is done during my TypeScript learning process guided by [Stephen Grider](https://github.com/StephenGrider) course on Udemy called [Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/typescript-the-complete-developers-guide/).

The main mission of this task or project is to show the use of `interfaces` and `abstract classes`. As well as the best way to reuse code.

- You can see the code with the implementation of an interface from the commit [`c454e64`](https://github.com/dEzequiel/be-organized/commit/c454e64).
- You can see the code with the implementation of an abstract class from the commit [`2edc3d5`](https://github.com/dEzequiel/be-organized/commit/2edc3d51adf77cd1614d6281cb4f35aa8c82d470).
